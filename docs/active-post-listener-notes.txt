Active Post Listener Notes
__________________________

- Have NO users collection (or at least no active posts stored for users in it)

- Have 3 query listeners: 1 where donor == email, 1 where recipient == email, and 1 where transporter == email

- Keep getAvailableOffers as a single use get, but change all others (getFoodDonations, getReceivedFood(/getClaimedOffers), getFoodDeliveries) to be set with those query listeners

- Remove all calls to those removed single use gets, all instances where the state for those lists are set

- Make currentJob in delivery be set from snapshot, handle error case of there being multiple active currentJobs

- Remove all instances where state for currentJob is set in local methods

- If need to track who is pending assignment, store "pendingTransporter" = email in the post itself
