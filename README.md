# LEFTOVERS
Taking the inconvenience out of food donation.

---

## WHY
[30 to 40 percent](https://www.rts.com/resources/guides/food-waste-america/#:~:text=Here's%20some%20%E2%80%9Cfood%E2%80%9D%20for%20thought,tons%20of%20food%20every%20year.&text=That's%2080%20billion%20pounds%20of,of%20the%20US%20food%20supply.) of the United States' food supply is wasted every year. And yet, "[12.3 percent](https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/press-room/new-data) of American households remain food insecure". The problem isn't that we don't have enough food - it's that we're not distributing it properly.

The idea behind Leftovers is that by making food donation super-convenient, we can bridge the gap between unused food and the people that need it.

## WHAT
Leftovers is a mobile application that matches people who have food to donate with recipient organizations and transporters.

## WHO
Anyone can donate, and anyone can deliver after having their application approved. Recipients must be verifiable food distribution organizations.
